# openCameraV_updated
openCameraV for FiveM 'updated' for use up to gamebuild 3717 (mp2025_02) 'A Safehouse in the Hills'

This is an 'updated' version of OpenIVs openCameraV plugin.

This plugin removes the camera distance limits in the Rockstar Editor so you can move your camera anywhere without hitting the red 'out of bounds' barrier.

### How to install the plugin:
1. Click this link: https://github.com/KevinL852/openCameraV_updated/releases or click the release on the right.
2. Find the latest release or for your gamebuild and click 'Source code (zip)'. It is recommended to always use the latest release as it'll work on older gamebuilds anyway.
3. Open the "FiveM Application Data" folder and navigate to the 'plugins' folder. If you don't have a plugins folder, create one.
4. Drag & drop the 'openCameraV_bXXXX.asi' from the .zip downloaded on step 2, into the plugins folder and you should be good to go.
